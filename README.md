# Jack's Randomized Prework Study Guide

## Description

I was motivated by this project to create a simple app that will enable me to more effectively study for upcoming projects in my coding bootcamp.  This project allows me to randomly select a topic and find information.  It also accomplishes the acceptance criteria that I laid out in the beginning of this assignment.  While I knew most of the HTML and CSS going in, I learned a bit about Javascript (specifically "for loops").

## Installation

None necessary :) Just view the webpage.

## Usage 

To use the randomized study guide, press control-shift-C if you're on Windows.  If not, right-click anywhere on the page and select "inspect" from the drop-down list.  Once there, navigate to the "console" option (the second tab, next to "Elements.")  Once there, simply look at the print out in the console and begin studying the selected topic.  

### Rolling the Dice
If you would like to "roll the dice" and select a new topic, simply refresh the page and a new topic will be selected for you!
